## 문제 설명
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).


# Example 1
<img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/31/1483_ex1.png">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]
Output: 15
```

# Example 2:

```
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 19
```

# Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100

## 문제풀이
```python
class Solution:
    def deepestLeavesSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        travle_queue = [root]
        while travle_queue:
            pre, travle_queue = travle_queue, [child for p in travle_queue for child in [p.left, p.right] if child]
        return sum(node.val for node in pre)
```
