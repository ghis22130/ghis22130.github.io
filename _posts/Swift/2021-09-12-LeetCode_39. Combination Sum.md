## 문제 설명

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note**: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

# Example 1

<img align = "center" src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/minpath.jpg">

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```

# Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
```

# Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

## 문제풀이
```swift
import Foundation


class Solution {
    
    var dp: [Int] = []
    var dx = [1,0]
    var dy = [0,1]
    
    func minPathSum(_ grid: [[Int]]) -> Int {
        let N = grid.count
        let M = grid[0].count
        
        dp = Array(repeating: 0, count: N*M)
        dp[0] = grid[0][0]
        
        for i in 0..<N {
            for j in 0..<M {
                for k in 0..<2 {
                    if i+dy[k] < N && j+dx[k] < M {
                        let y = i+dy[k]
                        let x = j+dx[k]
                        
                        if dp[y*M+x] != 0 {
                            dp[y*M+x] = min(dp[y*M+x], dp[i*M+j]+grid[y][x])
                        } else {
                            dp[y*M+x] = dp[i*M+j]+grid[y][x]
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp.last!
    }
}

```
