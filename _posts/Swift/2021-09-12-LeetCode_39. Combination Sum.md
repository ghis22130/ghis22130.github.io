## 문제 설명

Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all **unique combinations** of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

# Example 1

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
```

# Example 2:

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
```

# Example 3:

```
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

# Example 4:

```
Input: candidates = [1], target = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

# Example 5:

```
Input: candidates = [1], target = 2
Output: [[1,1]]
```


# Constraints:

- 1 <= candidates.length <= 30
- 1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
- All elements of candidates are distinct.
- 1 <= target <= 500

```swift
import Foundation

class Solution {
    
    func solution(_ index: Int, _ candidates: [Int], _ target: Int, _ answer: inout [Int], _ answers: inout [[Int]]) {
        if target == 0 {
            answers.append(answer)
            return
        }
        
        for i in index..<candidates.count {
            if candidates[i] <= target {
                answer.append(candidates[i])
                solution(i, candidates, target - candidates[i], &answer, &answers)
                _ = answer.removeLast()
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    func combinationSum(_ candidates: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [[Int]] {
        var answers:[[Int]] = []
        var answer: [Int] = []
        solution(0, candidates, target, &answer, &answers)
        return answers
    }
}
